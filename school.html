     <h2>My School Journey</h2>

     <p>I’m currently a student at Cerritos College where I’m learning about computer science and cybersecurity. One of my main goals is to transfer to Long Beach State University and finish my bachelor’s degree there.</p>

     <p>I’m also studying for two important certifications: <strong>Network+</strong> and <strong>Security+</strong>. These are helping me build skills that I’ll use in a real cybersecurity job.</p>

     <p>Right now, I’m taking classes like networking, web development (HTML and CSS), and security basics. I’m trying to stay focused and learn as much as I can each semester.</p>
