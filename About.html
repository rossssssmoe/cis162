    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Moises, but I go by Ross. I'm 28 years old and have a huge passion for creating 4K videos, capturing memories with my family and friends.
    Videography allows me to express creativity and bring moments to life through cinematic visuals.</p>
    <p>Alongside my passion for videography, I am pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity because technology has always fascinated me.
    I aim to combine my technical skills with creative storytelling to explore exciting opportunities in both fields.</p>
