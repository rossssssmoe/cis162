    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>This is my videography site. I enjoy filming and capturing cool moments. Feel free to check out my contact page and my gallery.Cybersecurity really caught my attention when I started learning how easy it is for people to get hacked or scammed without even realizing it. I didn’t grow up knowing much about online safety, but once I started studying it in school, I knew it was something I wanted to dive into. I like the idea of protecting others — whether it’s keeping their personal info safe or helping them avoid online threats. At the same time, I’ve always enjoyed being creative through videos. I want to use that skill to spread awareness and explain cybersecurity in a way that actually makes sense to everyday people. It’s something I care about and want to keep getting better at.</p>
